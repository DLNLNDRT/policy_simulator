# Product Scenarios Prioritization — GenAI Health‑Data Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

**Scenarios Evaluated:** 10  
**Top 3 Selected:**  
1. **Policy Simulation Assistant (MVP)** – Forecast impact of workforce or spending changes on outcomes  
2. **Health Benchmark Dashboard** – Cross-country anomaly detection and peer comparison  
3. **Narrative Insight Generator** – AI-generated, citation-linked country health briefs  

**MVP Scope (Cursor-optimized):**  
A **GenAI Policy Simulation Assistant** that uses existing datasets to predict the directional effect of input changes (e.g., doctor density, nurse density, government spending) on life expectancy, returning **explanations, graphs, and narrative summaries**.  
Deployed as a **TypeScript + Supabase app** with **GPT-powered narrative layer**, **retrieval-based analytics**, and **simple what-if simulation UI**.

## 3. Technical Feasibility Assessment

| Component | Description | Feasibility | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Data Readiness** | Life expectancy, workforce density, spending, mortality datasets cleaned & merged | ✅ High | Supabase tables from `merged_dataset.xlsx` |
| **AI/ML Layer** | Regression + correlation inference for simulation | ✅ High | Python + OpenAI fine-tuning or on-the-fly GPT |
| **Narrative Layer** | GPT-powered explanation with structured prompt templates | ✅ High | OpenAI GPT-4/5 API |
| **Infrastructure** | Supabase backend + TypeScript/React frontend in Cursor IDE | ✅ High | Already compatible stack |
| **Visualization** | Recharts + Tailwind integration for graphs | ✅ High | Local |
| **Monitoring / RLS** | Row Level Security in Supabase | ✅ Medium | Use policies per country/user |
| **Explainability Layer** | LIME-style local surrogate text output | ✅ Medium | Optional in Phase 2 |

**Conclusion:**  
The MVP can be built with **existing stack (Cursor IDE + Supabase + GPT-5)** and does not require new datasets or cloud migration. All major dependencies are ready.

## 4. MVP Definition

### MVP Name:  
**Policy Simulation Assistant (GenAI-powered “What-if” Engine)**

### Core Features  
1. User selects a **country** and modifies sliders for **doctor density**, **nurse density**, and **health spending**.  
2. System runs regression model and returns predicted **change in life expectancy**.  
3. GPT layer generates **explanatory narrative** with uncertainty and citations.  
4. Interactive chart displays baseline vs projected outcomes.  
5. Export as **policy brief PDF**.

### Acceptance Criteria  
- ✅ User can run simulation for at least 10 countries.  
- ✅ Output includes numerical prediction ± confidence interval.  
- ✅ Narrative includes causal context and footnotes.  
- ✅ Latency < 5 seconds per simulation.  
- ✅ Deployed securely with Supabase RLS.
