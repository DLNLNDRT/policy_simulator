# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## ✅ **Issue Fixed**
The deployment error was caused by `sqlite3` being listed in requirements.txt. `sqlite3` is a built-in Python module and shouldn't be listed as a dependency.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**
1. **Removed `sqlite3`** from requirements.txt
2. **Created `requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt`** with minimal dependencies
3. **Fixed dependency resolution** for Streamlit Cloud

## 🌐 **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**

### **Step 1: Use the Correct Requirements File**
For Streamlit Cloud deployment, you have two options:

**Option A: Use the minimal requirements file**
- Rename `requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt` to `requirements.txt`
- This includes only essential dependencies

**Option B: Use the fixed main requirements file**
- The main `requirements.txt` now has `sqlite3` removed
- This includes all dependencies but is cloud-compatible

### **Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**
1. **Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)**
2. **Sign in with GitHub**
3. **Click "New app"**
4. **Repository**: Select your repository
5. **Branch**: `master`
6. **Main file path**: `streamlit_eda_dashboard.py`
7. **Advanced settings**:
   - **Python version**: 3.11 (recommended)
   - **Requirements file**: `requirements.txt` (or `requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt`)
8. **Click "Deploy!"**

## 📋 **Deployment Checklist**
- ✅ Repository pushed to GitHub
- ✅ `sqlite3` dependency removed
- ✅ Streamlit configuration created
- ✅ Data files in `adapt_context/data/`
- ✅ Main file: `streamlit_eda_dashboard.py`

## 🧪 **Test Locally First**
```bash
# Test with minimal requirements
pip install -r requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt
streamlit run streamlit_eda_dashboard.py
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If deployment still fails:**
1. **Check Python version**: Use Python 3.11
2. **Verify requirements**: Ensure no built-in modules are listed
3. **Check file paths**: Ensure `adapt_context/data/` exists
4. **Review logs**: Check Streamlit Cloud logs for specific errors

### **Common Issues:**
- **Missing data files**: Ensure `adapt_context/data/` is in repository
- **Python version**: Use Python 3.11 for best compatibility
- **Memory limits**: Streamlit Cloud has memory limits

## 🎯 **Expected Result**
Your dashboard should now deploy successfully to Streamlit Cloud and be accessible at:
`https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`

**Deployment should now work! 🎉**
