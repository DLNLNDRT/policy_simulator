# 🔧 Railway Healthcheck Fix

## ❌ **Issue Identified**
Railway healthcheck was failing because the application was hardcoded to port 8005, but Railway sets the PORT environment variable dynamically.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **Files Updated**
1. **`comprehensive_demo_server.py`** - Now reads PORT from environment variable
2. **`Dockerfile`** - Updated to expose dynamic PORT
3. **Health endpoint** - Already exists at `/health`

### **What's Fixed**
- ✅ Application now uses Railway's PORT environment variable
- ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ Server starts on the correct port
- ✅ Railway healthcheck should pass

## 🚀 **Redeploy on Railway**

### **Option 1: Redeploy Current Project**
1. **Go to Railway dashboard**
2. **Click "Redeploy"** on your project
3. **Railway will use the updated code**

### **Option 2: Delete and Redeploy**
1. **Delete current Railway project**
2. **Create new project**
3. **Select your GitHub repository**
4. **Railway will use the fixed code**

## 📋 **What Should Happen Now**
- ✅ Application starts on Railway's assigned port
- ✅ Health endpoint responds at `/health`
- ✅ Railway healthcheck passes
- ✅ Application becomes healthy

## 🌐 **Your URLs After Fix**
- **Main Dashboard**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- **API Documentation**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/docs`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/health`

## 🔍 **Health Check Response**
The `/health` endpoint should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "policy-simulation-assistant-complete-mvp",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "features": ["simulation", "benchmark", "narrative", "quality", "analytics"]
}
```

**Redeploy and the healthcheck should pass! 🎉**
