# 🔧 Railway Deployment Fix

## ❌ **Issue Identified**
Railway was trying to build the project as a Node.js application because it detected `package.json`, but we want to deploy the Python FastAPI backend only.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **Files Created/Updated**
1. **`.railwayignore`** - Excludes frontend and Node.js files
2. **`requirements_railway.txt`** - Python-only requirements
3. **`railway.json`** - Updated with correct build command

### **What's Fixed**
- ✅ Railway will now deploy Python backend only
- ✅ Frontend files ignored (not needed for API deployment)
- ✅ Correct requirements file specified
- ✅ Proper build command configured

## 🚀 **Redeploy on Railway**

### **Option 1: Automatic Redeploy**
1. **Go to your Railway dashboard**
2. **Click "Redeploy"** on your project
3. **Railway will use the new configuration**

### **Option 2: Delete and Redeploy**
1. **Delete the current Railway project**
2. **Create a new project**
3. **Select your GitHub repository again**
4. **Railway will use the updated configuration**

## 📋 **What Railway Will Deploy**
- ✅ **Python FastAPI backend only**
- ✅ **All 5 features** (Simulation, Benchmark, Narrative, Quality, Analytics)
- ✅ **Public API endpoints**
- ✅ **Interactive dashboard**
